if you're just starting out in web development you might feel like the only websites you can create are those with a
0:05
dated '90s look today that changes get ready to flex your skills because we're going to build one of the most
0:11
impressive websites you can create using just HTML and CSS I know you might be a
0:17
complete beginner so don't worry I'll break down every single step ensuring everything is clear and easy to follow
0:23
before we dive into the coding let's take a moment to preview the final project
0:32
[Music]
0:43
and remember your likes and subscriptions are a huge support for this growing Channel they help us keep
0:49
creating content like this so thank you in advance without further Ado let's get started and make something amazing
0:56
together [Music]
1:08
before we begin coding it's essential to prepare some resources including images and videos these can be found in the
1:14
GitHub repository Linked In the description box head to the repository and once you're there take a moment to
1:21
give it a star to support the project after that locate the two
1:26
folders within the repository download all the files from these folders and organize them on your computer a good
1:32
approach is to create a main folder and within it separate subfolders for the images and videos next open your
1:39
preferred code editor drag and drop the folder you just organized into the editor this will make
1:46
it easier to access and reference the files as we build the project we'll start by creating two
1:51
files one for the HTML structure called index.html and another for The Styling
1:57
named style.css these files will be the foundation of the project open the
2:02
index.html file and set up the basic HTML framework be sure to include a
2:08
title that reflects the purpose of your website once that's done open the file in your browser using a tool like live
2:14
server this will let you see the changes you make in real time inside the body section of the HTML create a div element
2:21
with a class name of container this div will act as a wrapper for all the elements we'll be adding the first
2:28
element we need is a video that will serve as the background to do this add a video tag inside the container and Link
2:35
the galaxy. mpp4 file you downloaded earlier make sure the video file located
2:40
in the correct folder so the link works seamlessly to make the video function as
2:46
a proper background add the following properties to it autoplay Loop muted and
2:51
plays inline these ensure the video starts automatically plays continuously has no sound and works properly on
2:58
mobile browsers additionally assign the video a class name such as back vid so it can be styled
video background
3:04
later now we need to link the CSS file to our project to do this go to the Head
3:10
section of your HTML file and include the link to the CSS file this will
3:15
ensure that the Styles we Define are applied to our web page once that's done
3:21
navigate to the CSS file and start by targeting the body element the goal here
3:26
is to remove the default margin and padding that browsers typically add this gives us a clean slate for styling next
3:33
choose a font family that suits the design and set the default text color to a light
3:44
gray now move on to styling the container set its position to relative to allow precise control over the
3:51
positioning of child elements Define its width as 100% and its height as 100
3:57
viewport height or 100 V this ensures the container spans the full height of the
4:04
screen for the back vid class which is the video element set its position to
4:10
Absolute then align it by setting right and bottom to
4:18
zero to make sure the video stays behind other elements assign it a zindex of
4:23
niif one at this stage the video should be correctly positioned as a background
4:28
to ensure the video displays perfectly on all screen sizes we'll use a media query to handle aspect ratios start with
4:35
a Max aspect ratio of 16
4:44
to9 for this condition set the video's width to Auto and its height to 100%
4:50
this will keep the video's proportions intact for wider
4:56
screens for a Min aspect ratio set the width to 100% and the height to Auto this ensures the
5:03
video fits well on taller screens without Distortion with these adjustments the video background will be responsive and
5:09
look great across different devices and screen sizes the website is looking great so far now let's add add a cover
5:17
to enhance its design to do this go to the HTML file and right below the video
5:22
element create a div with the class name cover next move to your CSS file always
5:28
place your media queries at the bottom of the stylesheet after all other
5:34
styles Target the cover class and set its position to fixed use the inset
5:40
property to set the top bottom left and right values to zero finally apply a
5:45
dark purple color to the cover that complements your
5:51
design with the cover in place let's move on to creating the header section in the HTML file below the cover
5:58
div add a header element inside the header start by creating a div with the
create the header
6:03
class name left within this left div add an image element for your logo you can
6:09
customize this logo to fit your brand below the image add an H2 element where you can include your name or brand
6:20
name next below the left div create an unordered list with three list items
6:26
each list item should contain an anchor tag name these links as follows about
6:31
skills and projects after the list add another div with the class name box
6:36
icons inside this div create three tags these will hold social media
6:45
icons to add the icons visit the website boxy cons.
6:51
comom on the box acons homepage click usage in the top right corner scroll
6:57
down until you see usage as a font copy the code snippet provided there and paste it inside the head tag of your
7:03
HTML file now go back to boxon and search for the social media icons you
7:08
want to use for example start with YouTube click on the icon choose the
7:14
font option and copy the code then paste it inside one of the P tags in your HTML
7:23
file repeat the process for two additional icons of your choice once you've added the icons move to the CSS
7:30
file to style the
7:43
header now let's style the header to give it a modern and clean appearance start by targeting the header itself in
7:49
the CSS set its display to flex to align its child elements neatly with a line
7:55
item set to Center and justify content to set the space between
8:04
add padding of zero and 30px for spacing and set it height to
8:11
70px next choose a white background color for the header and add a blur
8:17
effect using the backdrop filter property
8:30
to make the blur effects Stand Out adjust the background color to be slightly transparent this creates a
8:35
Sleek frosted glass appearance to enhance the header add a subtle box
8:45
Shadow use a color with a bit of transparency to keep it soft and
8:54
elegant finally set the Z index to 9 or 99 to ensure the header always always
8:59
displays above other elements now move on to styling the left class inside the
9:07
header set its display to flex and align its items to the
9:16
center for the image inside the left class set its width to 40 PX and add a margin of zero and 15 PX for proper
9:27
spacing for the h Two element in the left class we want part of its text to have a different color to achieve this
9:35
go back to the HTML file and wrap the portion of text you want to style inside a span element then add an inline style
9:43
to the span and set its color to your special blue this makes the header more visually
9:48
appealing returning to the CSS Target the unordered list inside the
9:56
header set its display to flex with justify content set the space between and give it a width of 30
10:06
Cent add padding of 15 PX and a border radius of 50 PX to give it a pill-shaped
10:18
appearance use a transparent dark blue background color and apply a blur effect
10:23
with backdrop filter
10:32
then enhance it further by adding a box Shadow for
10:46
depth next style the list items by removing their default list
10:54
style for the anchor tags inside the list remove the text decoration
11:01
set the color to white and make the font bold with a font weight of 700 add a transition effect for smooth animations
11:07
and give them a margin of 0er and 10 PX to create a hover effect add a text
11:13
Shadow when the user hovers over the links which makes the interaction more
11:24
Dynamic finally let's focus on the social media icons Target the icons div
11:30
and set its display to flex with a gap of 40px between the
11:39
icons for the P tags Inside the Box icons set their display to flex align
11:44
the items to the center and justify the content in the center as
11:52
well set their font size to 20 PX and make them circular by setting both their
11:57
width and height to 30 PX X add a two pixel solid border with a
12:05
special blue
12:10
color and applying a border radius of
12:16
50% and set the cursor to pointer for
12:23
interactivity for the hover effect change the background color to Blue the text color to
12:31
Black and add a box Shadow with a blue
12:42
glow to make the transition smoother apply a transition of 0.5 seconds to the
12:48
icons now here's where the fun really begins we're going to add a black hole video to the center of the header
12:53
creating a stunning visual effect to start navigate to your HTML file just
12:59
below below the header create a div with the class name black hole box inside
13:05
this div add a video element and Link the black hole. mpp4 file to its source attribute make sure to add the following
13:11
properties to the video autoplay Loop muted and place in line these settings
13:17
ensure the video plays automatically Loops seamlessly has no sound and works correctly across all
13:23
devices next move to your CSS file to style the black hole video
13:32
Begin by targeting the black hole box class set its position to Absolute and place it at the top of the page with top
13:38
zero make its width 100% to span the full width of the viewport use display
13:44
flex and justify content Center to Center the video horizontally within the box to make sure it stays behind the
13:50
header assign it a zindex of 91
14:00
now style the video element inside the black hole box set its width to 100% so
14:05
it scales appropriately with the screen size to position it at the very top of the page apply a margin top of 9
14:12
23.5 at this stage you might notice that the black hole video is displaying above the background video disrupting the
14:18
design to fix this we'll blend the two videos together inside the black hole
14:24
box div use the mix blend mode property and set it to light lighten this creates
14:30
a beautiful merging effect between the black hole video and the background making it look phenomenal you might
14:37
notice a faint line appearing from the black hole video don't worry about that now we'll address it by adding a hero
14:43
section next now let's move on to the next section of our project which is the hero
14:50
section go to your HTML file and below the black hole box div create a new
14:55
section with the class name hero this will serve as the main contain container for this part of the web page the first
create hero-section
15:01
part of the hero section will be the hero info div inside this div start by
15:07
creating another div with the class name title for this title we want to add an
15:12
icon visit boxy con.com search for the sketch
15:18
icon select the font option and copy the provided code paste this code inside the
15:24
title div below the icon add the corresponding text to complete the title
15:35
once the title is in place let's create the other parts of the hero info section below the title div add an H1
15:43
element with the text providing the best project experience this headline will serve as the central message of the hero
15:51
section next add a P tag below the H1 include descriptive text that
15:57
complements the headline finally add a button element as the last part of the hero info section inside this button
16:04
will include another icon and some text go back to box AC cons. search for the
16:10
send icon and copy its code paste the icon code inside the button followed by the text contact me at this point all
16:17
the necessary elements for the hero info section are in place now head over to the CSS file to
16:24
style them let's now style the hero section and bring it to life start by
16:29
targeting the hero section in the CSS set its position to relative to establish its context for absolutely
16:36
positioned child elements make it span the full width of the screen by setting its width to 100%
16:43
And set its height to 80 V for a balanced layout use align items Center
16:49
and justify content space between to ensure everything inside is aligned neatly and spaced out properly next
16:56
focus on the hero info div position it absolutely and place it slightly from the left by setting left
17:03
5% this ensures it sits in a prominent location within the hero section now
17:08
let's style the individual elements inside hero info begin with the title class set its text color to Blue and add
17:15
padding of 8px 5px for spacing inside give it a rounded shape by setting a border radius of 50px and a border of 1
17:22
PX solid using a blue color with slight transparency set the width of the title to 240 PX apply a specific heximal
17:30
background color and add a subtle box Shadow for
17:48
depth next Target the H1 inside the hero info increase its font size to 60 PX and
17:56
limit its width to 600 PX for a structured layout
18:02
out set the font weight to 700 and the line height to match at 60px add a margin top of 40 PX and a
18:10
margin bottom of 30 PX for proper
18:22
spacing now style the P tag set its maximum width to 550 PX and a line
18:27
height of 25 PX to ensure readability add a margin bottom of 40px for spacing
18:33
and set its font size to 20 PX for a professional look for the button style
18:39

19:03
change the cursor to a pointer to indicate interactivity to make the button more Dynamic add a hover effect
19:09
when the user hovers over it increase the Box Shadow for
19:16
emphasis use a transition effect of3 seconds to make the hover effect
19:22
smooth finally let's add a gradient text effect to specific parts of the
19:27
H1 start by defining an animation within a class named
19:35
gradient set a linear gradient background that transitions from left to right using specific colors ensuring the
19:42
first and last colors are the same for a seamless Loop set the background size to 200% and
19:50
apply background clip text and- webkit background clip text to ensure only the
19:56
text shows the gradient
20:02
set webkit text fill color to transparent to hide the background behind the gradient Define the animation
20:08
itself with the name animate gradient which runs for 2.5 seconds uses
20:16
a linear timing function and Loops
20:24
infinitely to apply this gradient effect go to the HTML file and locate the H1
20:30
inside the hero info wrap the text Parts you want to animate like the best and experience in Span
20:39
elements and add the gradient class to these spans this applies the gradient effect to those specific
20:54
words finally ensure the gradient animation works by adding key Fram that change the background position to
21:04
200% this creates a smooth flowing gradient effect that looks fantastic and adds a vibrant touch to the
21:11
design let's enhance the hero section by adding an astronaut image go back to the HTML file and below the hero info div
21:19
create an IMG element link the astronaut. PNG file to its SRC attribute
21:29
and assign it a class name of
21:37
astronaut now move to the CSS file to style the astronaut image Target the astronaut class and set its position to
21:50
Absolute place it towards the right by setting right 5% adjust the size by
21:55
setting its height to 400 PX to seamlessly blend the astronaut image
22:01
with the background video apply the mix blend mode property and set it to lighten this will integrate the image
22:07
beautifully into the scene with that complete let's transition to the final section of our project in the HTML file
22:15
below the hero section create a new section with the class name about
22:24
section inside this section start by creating a div with the class name info card each info card will consist of a
create info-cards
22:32
Deb H1 element for the title and a P tag for additional
22:43
details once the first card is created simply copy and paste the info card code
22:48
three more times to create additional cards customize the details for each
22:53
card for instance the second card might highlight achievements such as more than seven technical
23:04
skills once that's done let's move on to styling the last section of our project in the CSS file start by targeting the
23:12
about section set its display property to flex to arrange the info cards side by side use justify content space
23:19
between to evenly distribute them across the section add padding of 0 10% to
23:25
create some spacing on the sides ensuring the section looks well balanced next Target the infocard divs set their
23:33
display property to flex and align items to the Center for a neat and uniform layout limit their maximum width to 120
23:39
PX to maintain a consistent size for all cards now style the H1 inside each card
23:46
to give it a dynamic touch adjust the text gradient animation copy the gradient animation code from the
23:52
previously defined gradient class and paste it here then set the font size to
23:57
55 PX to make the titles prominent add a margin top of 20 PX for spacing and
24:03
ensure both the top and bottom margins are set to zero for
24:10
alignment for the P tags inside the cards set the text color to white for readability and adjust the font size to
24:18
20 PX for a professional and Polished look with these adjustments the layout
24:24
and styling of the about section are complete next we'll focus on making the website responsive for tablets and
24:31
mobile devices finally We'll add a simple reload animation to give the website an engaging Finishing
24:41
Touch let's make the website fully responsive starting with adjustments for
24:47
tablets for screen sizes smaller than 1,000 pixels we'll tweak some Styles in
24:53
your CSS file add a media query for screens under 1,000 pixels
make it responsive for tablets
25:08
first modify the black hole video by changing its margin top to Native
25:16
20% Then adjust the H1 inside the hero info section by setting its font size to
25:22
40 PX and reducing its maximum width to 400 PX
25:31
next Target the P tag in the hero info and set its maximum width to 300 PX for
25:36
better readability for the hero image scale it down by setting its height to 300
25:46
PX in the about section reduce the padding to 10 PX and set the width to 90% for a snug
25:56
fit last for the H1 inside the info card add a slight adjustment by setting its
26:02
margin left to 5px these changes ensure the site looks great on
make it responsive for mobile
26:15
tablets now let's make it mobile
26:24
friendly add another media query for screens smaller than 700 pixels
26:34
first hide the unordered list in the header by setting its display property to none for the black hole video adjust the
26:41
margin top to n
26:47
11px next focus on the about section set its width to 80% and apply Flex wrap
26:53
wrap to ensure the layout adapts to smaller screens
26:58
for the hero class change the flex direction to column for a vertical arrangement in the hero info adjust the
27:05
bottom positioning to 10
27:10
PX scale the hero image further by setting its height to 200 PX move it
27:16
slightly by positioning it 100 PX from the right and 70 PX from the top uh you
27:22
might notice an issue where the container doesn't cover the entire section that's not in the viewport this
27:27
happens because its height is set to 100 VH fix this by targeting the container
27:34
class and setting its height to 100% with these updates your website now
27:39
looks fantastic on all screen sizes from tablets to mobile devices the final step is adding a
27:45
Reload animation uh which will be a fun and simple enhancement to make the website even more
add reload animation
27:52
engaging to add reload animations to our project we'll use the AOS animate on
27:58
scroll Library start by searching AOS on Google and clicking on the AOS page this
28:04
Library offers a wide range of reload animations to access the library go to
28:10
the top right corner of the AOS website and click the GitHub icon this will take you to the libraryies GitHub repository
28:17
once there scroll down until you find the basic installation section copy the code for the library
28:23
stylesheet and paste it into the head section of your HTML file then copy the
28:29
script code and paste it inside the body section below all your other elements now head back to the AOS website to
28:36
explore the available animations let's start by adding a fade down animation to our header copy the
28:42
relevant code snippet and paste it inside the header tag in your
28:50
HTML to customize it further add the data AOS duration attribute and set it
28:56
to 2,000 milliseconds reload the project in your browser and
29:02
you'll see the header animate as the page loads next apply the same reload animation to the black hole video copy
29:09
the fade down code and paste it inside the black hole box div it looks great already let's enhance the hero info
29:16
section by adding a fade right animation copy the code from the AOS site paste it into the hero info div and
29:23
set the animation duration to 1,000 milliseconds
29:30
to add a bit more detail copy the same fade right animation for the H1 inside the hero info but increase the duration
29:37
to 3,000 milliseconds for a smooth gradual effect finally let's make the hero image
29:44
pop by adding a Zoomin animation on the AOS site scroll down to find the zoom in
29:49
animation copy its code and paste it into the hero image tag set the animation duration to 2,000 milliseconds
29:56
for a dramatic effect congratulations my friend you've
